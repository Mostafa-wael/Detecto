## Introduction to the problem
Handwriting is an important piece of evidence that is examined in the questioned document to ensure its authenticity. 
Handwriting is the written speech of an individual who has characteristics that set him apart from others. 
It is a learned skill and a complex perceptual-motor task, also known as a neuromuscular task. 
Visual observation, outline conception, central nervous system pathways, and the anatomy and physiology of the bones and muscles of the hand and arm all work together to produce the desired output. 
Writing is a function of the conscious and subconscious mind, as well as of the body's motor, muscular, and nerve movements.
Handwriting has distinct characteristics that are unique to each individual and can be used for personal identification. 
In an extended handwriting sample, no two people write exactly alike, according to the basic principle of handwriting identification. 
The possibility of distinguishing the gender of the writer from his/her handwriting has been the pursuit of many investigations. 
Handwriting is said to be brainwriting, so the thinking of a male differs greatly from that of a female due to hormonal involvement and differences in their physiology, which may not only alter their neuromotor functioning, as a result of which writing work is done but also their way of thinking differs and thus characteristic. 
So handwriting which is observed during the examination may be proven to be showing discriminatory features in male and female handwriting.
